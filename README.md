# MovieNet
A complete React js movie application.

---


## Project Description

MovieNet has all the features a movie website needs. Users can search for any movie or TV show, and the site will filter results and display them in a user-friendly way. You can also see trending movies and TV shows, as well as popular ones.

When you click on a specific movie or TV show, you'll get more details about it. At the bottom of the details page, there are related official videos and a list of similar movies. You can also watch the movie trailer in a popup.

In the Explore section, users can browse movies and TV shows, filter them by genre, and sort them easily. Navigation is simple, with options to explore both movies and TV shows from the header.
